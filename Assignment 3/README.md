# Assignment 3

## Assignment Instructions:

You will pick a subject to create a webpage about. This subject can be movies, sports, places to
hang out, historical places, or places you have traveled. The choice of the theme and content is
up to you. You will need to create at least three web pages. All three web pages will have a title
in the boiler plate with your full name in it.

The first web page will be a home page to navigate to all of the other webpages. On your
homepage you will create a navbar with links to go to the other webpages. You will have an
image on your homepage that is centered on the page. The image will be an image that
represents your content.

The second web page must have an article of information on the content. You can find an article
and use the content from that article. You are not expected to write an article. This will not be
published so you do not need to worry about plagiarism. The content must be enough to fill two
columns. The page also must have a background color instead of just white. The paragraphs
bust also contain a border of your choosing. You must have a navigation link to take you back to
the homepage.

The third page will contain a form to fill out information about a person. On the third page you
must have one transition and one animation of your choosing. You also must have at least one
button to bring up a alert. The entire background must be the same color as the second page
You must have a navigation link to bring you back to the homepage.

## Pages
### Home Page
This is the landing page. It has a title and links to connect to other HTML pages to learn more.

### About Page
This page has more information about the importance of movies. This article was not written by me and 
is not being used for commercial purposes. It is simply a placeholder to highlight the formatting. The content
fills two columns. There is a link to go back to the homepage that is interactive.

### User Info Page
This page is the most interactive for the user. There is a form to fill out with your name and your favorite movie. There 
are also some buttons from which you can choose your favorite movie. Each of those buttons includes an alert. 
My bias can be found as the "wrong" choices start to disappear over time, which shows off CSS animation. Also, if you hover over the 
film reel image, it will slowly start to grow, showing off CSS transitions. There is also a back button that is animated.
