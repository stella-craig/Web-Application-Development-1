    <h1>Why Movies Still Matter</h1>
    <h2>Written by Richard Brody for The New Yorker</h2>

    <div>
    <p>In a new piece on Wired.com, “Could This Be the Year Movies Stopped Mattering?” Brian 
        Raftery suggests that movies have “devolved from Culture-Conquering Pastime to merely 
        Something to Do When the Wi-Fi’s Down,” and that their former centrality to the culture 
        has been taken over by a diverse range of media events—serial television above all, but 
        also Pokémon Go, “Hamilton,” YouTube memes, and visual albums such as Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” 
        The simplest refutation is that what matters is determined not by media discussion but by 
        each person for herself; movies matter to me, therefore they matter. </p>

    <p>But Raftery is on to something important, even if, as I think, he comes at it backward. 
        He’s right that the kinds of work that capture widespread attention and find widespread 
        favor have changed in recent years—and he’s right that these changes are inseparable from 
        the realm of criticism, the very nature of which has changed drastically in the same period. 
        Raftery’s fixation on “the pop-cultural conversation” and the “zeitgeist” is one that’s shared 
        by the era, by the critical community at large, and this fixation yields its own predestined 
        results. Modern cultural criticism gives rise to its own cultural artifacts, and the two fit 
        together like a lock and key. As a work of criticism, Raftery’s essay is exemplary of the very 
        phenomenon that he’s documenting—and that circularity, that self-fulfilling critical criterion, 
        is the defining trait of the time. </p>
        
    <p>The rise of so-called quality television has coincided with the advent of widespread access to 
        the Internet, which is closely correlated with consumers’ level of education. The serial nature 
        of serial television lent itself to online discussion—blogs, comments, e-mails, and then, a few 
        years later, social-media postings—in a way that the one-time-only and freestanding experience 
        of going to a movie doesn’t, at the same time that it also locked specifically into the new habits 
        of the educated in a way that moviegoing didn’t. </p>
        
    <p>The principal quality of quality TV has proven to be its ability to generate discourse—not just on 
        the part of critics and viewers but on the part of journalists. As particular series, and television 
        over all, became the subjects of widespread public discussion—discussion in the literal sense, of writers 
        and viewers responding to each other—that discussion became news. Suddenly, television was propelled 
        from the arts page to the front page, and that trend was accelerated by the nature of the shows. Their 
        emphasis on stories and characters involving iconic phenomena in cultural history and hot-button issues 
        of contemporary sociology and politics grabbed—and still grabs—hold of journalists’ nose for stories. 
        Many series seem to exist only to present topics in ready-to-debate form; they are built to give rise to 
        “think pieces,” which have become the dominant, if easily parodied, critical mode. </p>
        
    <p>The experience that the watching and the critique of new serial television resemble above all is the 
        college experience. Binge-watching is cramming, and the discussions that are sparked reproduce academic 
        habits: What It Says About, What It Gets Right About, What It Gets Wrong About. There is a lot of aboutness 
        but very little being; lots of puzzle-like assembling of information to pose particular kinds of questions 
        (posing questions—sounds like a final exam), to explore particular issues (sounds like a term paper). For 
        these reasons, television’s actual competition isn’t movies or museums or novels but nonfiction books, 
        documentary films, journalism, radio discussions, and general online clicking. Serial television is designed 
        to gratify the craving for facts to piece together and analyze. The medium seems created for the media buzz 
        that’s generated by the media people who are its natural audience, and to whom the shows owe their acclaim, 
        their prestige, and their success. </p>
       
        
    <p>Even now, the way that Raftery underlines the importance of new television shows is with the assertion that 
        “they certainly won the impossible to quantify—yet equally hard to deny—metrics of online chatter, where they 
        spawned countless essays and arguments for weeks and months on end.” Just as the numbers matter for the TV 
        business, the quantity of chatter matters for the culture business, because it’s what happens when the work 
        of art extends beyond itself into other fields and makes its influence apparent. That’s why so much of the 
        discourse generated by television is political—and why, in this moment that’s so rich in cultural discourse, 
        the dominant way of discussing art is political. </p>
        
    <p>Raftery displays the skewed results of this trend when he cites three recent movies that strike him as “culturally 
        crucial”: “Straight Outta Compton,” a good movie; “Inside Out,” a mediocre one; and “The Wolf of Wall Street,” 
        a great one. What makes them important, in his eyes, is that “they spurred uncomfortable but essential conversations.” 
        Here, he’s practicing the echo-chamber mode of criticism: the movies are crucial because they spark “conversations,” 
        they spark conversations because they address issues that are deemed crucial. He considers these movies—unlike those 
        he’s seen this year—to be important, and his criterion for their importance is that they’re politically relevant, 
        not that they’re of aesthetic value. What’s more, he measures political relevance by counting clicks. </p>
        
    <p>Ultimately, democratic politics are a numbers game. Politics are what concern everyone, which is why “everyone” (i.e., 
        those who create the “online chatter” and the “countless essays and arguments” by which Raftery measures importance) 
        talks about politics. Art, by contrast, is what concerns one person, intimately. Culture is a matter of power; art 
        is a matter of beauty. It’s also a matter of freedom—of spiritual freedom, of free-spiritedness—and so it’s also 
        political, though not in any immediately recognizable way and, above all, not in any way that lends itself to the 
        think-piece brand of discourse. The power of beauty, the impact of beauty on a single person, eludes discussion and 
        invites silence, even as it incites something radically different from analysis: ecstasy. That’s the force behind the 
        side of criticism that, if it’s any good at all, converges with the work of art by being itself a literary, poetic, 
        philosophical inspiration. </p>
        
    <p>This is why much of the best art has always been a niche phenomenon, and why, when great art is popular, it’s often 
        due to a fortuitous accident, and the artist is often punished the next time around (as happened when Terrence Malick 
        followed “The Tree of Life” with “To the Wonder” and “Knight of Cups,” and as I hope won’t happen with Scorsese’s 
        next movie, “Silence”). That’s all the truer now with movies, because the role of the studios and of wide releases 
        has diminished. The possibility of making films independently and on a low budget is greater than ever, at exactly 
        the moment that studios, following the lead of television, have turned their movies mainly into political allegories 
        and statements precisely calculated to leap to the front pages and the op-ed section. </p>
        
    <p>At the same time, the democratization of criticism online has had a crucial and positive effect on cinematic events. 
        Today, there’s both more and better film criticism than ever; as a result, it’s less likely than ever that an extraordinary 
        movie will go utterly unnoticed or be dismissed. But the breadth of a film’s distribution and its box-office take are no 
        more measures of its merit than is the quantity of online discussion that it inspires. It’s common knowledge that, for 
        “Lemonade,” Beyoncé derived inspiration from, and made reference to, Julie Dash’s great 1991 feature “Daughters of the Dust,” 
        which, despite its generally favorable reception at the time of its release, is the only theatrical feature that Dash has 
        made. “Lemonade” also alludes to Khalik Allah’s bold and inventive documentary “Field Niggas.” Allah is also one of the 
        cinematographers on “Lemonade,” yet his feature film was hardly released at all; in New York, it only played for one week 
        at the IFP Media Center, in Brooklyn. “Daughters of the Dust” has taken in only 1.6 million dollars at the box office 
        during the past quarter century. (It will have a welcome and long-overdue rerelease in November.) Beyoncé’s allusions to 
        “Daughters of the Dust” and “Field Niggas” don’t make them better or more important films—those of us who have seen and 
        love those movies don’t need external confirmation of the experience. Rather, the references make “Lemonade” better and 
        more important. Beyoncé didn’t need voluminous online chatter to be moved and inspired by Dash’s and Allah’s work; she had 
        an experience of her own, and the intensity of that experience comes through in her own work. </p>
        
    <p>Is this year in movies, as Raftery asserts, the “Worst. Year. Ever.”?_ _I think it’s been a terrific year so far, with a 
        long list of remarkable new movies already released. With the New York Film Festival coming up, along with the packed fall 
        season and year-end releases, the list is likely to get much longer very soon. A year as a measure of film releases is an 
        odd artifice—production and distribution are cyclical, and this is a year featuring no new releases by some of the best 
        Hollywood or off-Hollywood directors, such as Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, Spike Lee, David Fincher, and Paul Thomas Anderson. 
        But other luminaries, including Martin Scorsese and James Gray, have movies coming up; so do notable independent filmmakers, 
        including Barry Jenkins and Matías Piñeiro. When, a quarter century from now, a pop-music visionary refers to “Men Go to Battle” 
        or “For the Plasma” or “Krisha” or “Viktoria” or “Kate Plays Christine” or another under-the-radar low-budget film of imagination 
        and ingenuity, woe unto the critics who were here at the time and didn’t pay attention. </p>
