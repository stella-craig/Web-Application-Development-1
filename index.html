//Week 1 HTML Example

<!DOCTYPE html> //not required but is good practice; tells us the document is of type html
<html lang="en"> //the tag is html and the attribute is lang
    <head> //beginning; head section has information that pertains to the document that we're going to use
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> //declares the type of texting
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-compatible" content="IE=edge"> //compatiability
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> //viewport is based on your monitor
        <title>Document</title> //the word that shows up in the tab when it opens
    </head> //end (in between the two tags is the information we need)
    <body> //body is where you define and place everything that's going to be displayed
        <h1>test</h1> //header one(bigger than header two and three)
        <h2>Stella</h2>
        <img src="test.png" alt="Test image" width="154" height="125"> //src: "source"; alt: what to show in case that image doesnt load
    </body>
</html>
