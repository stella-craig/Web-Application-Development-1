        <h1>Stella Craig</h1>
        <h2>Computer Science Junior</h2>
        <p1>My name is Stella Craig. I am a Junior studying computer science at the 
            University of Missouri. I just got back from Miami, Florida, where my mom 
            and I vacationed. We spent the entire week we were there just relaxing on 
            the beach. One of the days we were there, it rained, so we went to the Frost 
            Science Museum, where I had my mom take the below picture of me. My mom and 
            I are very close. I am very lucky to be from Columbia, so I am able to save 
            a lot of money by staying at home with my mom and commuting to school everyday. 
            I currently work at the Telecom building for the IT Department at Mizzou as 
            a student worker and building coordinator. In my free time I like to read, play 
            video games, and annoy my friends. I recently saw both Oppenheimer and Barbie 
            and I must say that the Barbie movie was better. But that is definitely influenced 
            by my love for Margot Robbie. She is also in my favorite movie of all time: 
            The Suicide Squad (2021), not to be confused by the dumpsterfire of a movie that 
            was Suicide Squad (2016) of course. When I get my own place, I want to own two 
            dogs, one cat, and a bunny. Two dogs is necessary because dogs are more social 
            animals so they can play with one another, but cats tend to be the opposite so 
            I'll only get one. And I want a bunny because it's a bunny and why wouldn't I 
            want one. Anyway, I don't know what more to say about myself. Hope you enjoyed!
