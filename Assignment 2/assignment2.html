            <td>Shane is a marriage-able villager in Stardew Valley. He is always the marriage 
                canidate that I marry. I think he has the best character development. He starts 
                off being very rude to the player as he is depressed and an alcoholic, but as you 
                befriend him, he warms up to you and gets help for his mental health. He loves chickens, 
                hot peppers, and pizza. He also will allow the player to purchase blue chickens. 
                His aunt is Marnie and he has a goddaughter named Jas.

    <p>
        Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games of all time. This is because it is such a pretty 
        game with a beautiful soundtrack. It is such a relazing game as well, as you can take life on 
        your farm as quickly or as slowly as you please. There are many different villagers, all with 
        their own stories and events for you to discover. You have large overarching goals throughout the 
        game, such as completing the Community Center bundles, filling out the museum, and reaching the bottom 
        of the mines. The gameplay is varied enough that you'll never be bored or without something to 
        do. You can get married and have kids, make friends, decorate and build your farm, own farm animals, 
        travel to different lands, and so much more. After quitting your job in the big city and coming back 
        to the farm your grandpa left you, life will never be the same again.
